/*  emd.css
*   Date: 01/05/2010
*
*   Body - fixed layout wireframe
*     #wrapper  for viewport
*     #banner for header
*     #status for msg, session area 
*     #side for navigation
*     #mainContent - for view templates
*     #footer
*
*   Best Practice Notes
*    () Use empty class on wrapper for psuedo namespace
*    () Use semantic approach for class and id names
*    () Use em and (%) from typography
*    () Make 1em predictable and easier to caculate by setting
*       font-size to 62.5% of browser default 16px to body element. 
*       Then 1em = 10px or 2.2em = 22px.
*    () 1024x768 best practice is to design to width 980px 
*    () Best practice font = linked fonts, web safe fonts, core web fonts, generic fonts
*      - Verdana = web safe, core, generic sans-serif
*      - Tahoma = web safe, generic sans-serif
*      - Arial = web safe, core, generic sans-serif
*      - (x) No linked font in current design
*    () Use @import for code development composition 
*    () For production; filter (remove comments, white space, line breaks, etc.)
*       and compress all rules into single emd.css file.
*
*   Typography Best Practice
*    () To scale text and positional elements use relative units in em or %.
*    () Use relative pixel units for precision control.
*    () The font size in the browser often defaults to 16px and the body tag font size is set to 100%
*       to create a fluid font size in the document. However, web developers think in terms of pixels
*       and useally require a handy calculator to convert pixels to em units. A best practice that is
*       taking off is to set the font-size to 62.5% in the body tag. This makes 10px = 1em or better 
*       still 12px = 1.2em. This elimates use of a calculator and rounding of pixels to em units.  
*    () Header size range 18-32 pixels and body copy 12-16 pixels.
*    () Body copy font size x 2 <= header font size
*    () Body copy font size x 1.5 = line height ( 2/3 rule min. font size to line height )
*    () Body copy size x 28 = column width, min-width: -10% width, max-width: +10% width 
*    () Common tag font sizes; h1 = 2em, p = 1em
*    () Paragraph spacing; line height x 0.75.
*    () Add equal margins to top and bottom of paragraph tag to avoid margin collapsing.
*       p { margin: 1em 0; }
*    () Do not underline to underline a:links until a:hover. 
*    () Color Associations
*       Color             Emotional Associations
*       Red               assertive, powerful, intense
*       Blue              consoling, fidelity, defense
*       Yellow            concern, rebirth, clarity
*       Green             wealth, fitness, food, nature
*       Brown             nature, maturity, wisdom
*       Orange            hospitality, exhilaration, vigor
*       Pink              vital, innocent, feminine
*       Purple            royalty, refinement, calm
*       Black             stark, stylish, somber
*       Gray              business-like, cool, detached
*       White             clean, pure, straightforward
*
*   Layout Notes
*    () IE doesn't support the global (*) rule, so default.css sets all block
*       element margins and padding to 0.
*    () IE doesn't support position rules on body, so viewport is wrapped in a <div>
*    () Tables are unique in nature and an external link will probably be moved to the content
*       page (table.html.erb) to load the stylesheet, which will minimize wire weight and file.size for emd.css.
*    () The layout is fixed except for the content in #mainContent area to minimize nesting of scroll bars and
*       improved style and rythm of page flow. The overflow of copy content in this area is managed with
*       vertical and horizontal scroll bars and all tables may have a vertical scroll bar for overflow. 
*    () The design is flexible to support small and large screens and to zoom text larger and smaller.
*       (*) Not all cases tested yet
